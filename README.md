# COVID-19 CAPNOGRAPH

A Capnograph is a medical device for measuring patient breathing CO2.

This project implements an open-source, cheap and quick to manufacture alternative to comercial capnographs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project is part of [Coronavirusmakers.org](https://www.coronavirusmakers.org/) maker movement.

## Software
We try to make the project easy replicable, so we code the project to be easily hacked to use your avaliable hardware materials. See the hardware section to understand wich hardware could work before trying to modify the software or colaborate to the project.

We are open to colaboration so we are expecting your pull request!! 

## Hardware
* CO2 sensor [(see documentation)](HW_co2sensors.md)
* Microcontroller [(see documentation)](HW_microcontrollers.md)
* Display [(see documentation)](HW_displays.md)
* Air acquisition [(see documentation)](HW_air_acquisition.md)
  * Air tubes
  * Water trap
  * Particulate hidrofobic filter
  * Pump

### "BricoLabs" prototype
The first prototype was funded by [BricoLabs](https://bricolabs.cc/) (OSHW maker non profit association) and builded by [TCRobotics](https://github.com/TCRobotics). Also the expensive CO2 sensor was provided for free for this project by [Gas Sensing Solutions UK](https://www.gassensing.co.uk/), thanks for all the help!

You have many photos at [Design/BricoLabs prototype](Design/BricoLabs%20prototype) folder.
